<h1>Mini paint</h1>
<p>
The subject of this task is to create a simplified paint application.

This task is divided into a lab part (12p) and a home part (12p). Note, that the home part is an expansion of the
former one, so it <b>a requirement</b> that the lab part is fully implemented in order to be able to get any points from the home part.
Otherwise, it will be graded with 0p. In any doubts about the application's functionality please refer to the sample app and/or ask your teacher.
</p>
<h2>Lab Part</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="Forms_14_Lab.exe">Example application</a></li>
	<li>Main window:
    <ul>
		<li>Starts in the center of the screen</li>
	    <li>The minimum window size: 640x480</li>
		<li>Main window contains three parts: toolstrip on the top, drawing area which takes 90% of 
		the window width regardless
		of the size and colors section which takes the remaining 10%
		</li>
		<li>Bitmap in the drawing area contains white background and always fills the entire drawing area space.</li>
		<li>Colors section on the right contains an empty group box that resizes along with the window.</li>
		<li>Toolstrip only contains the "Tools" section with a brush button.</li>
		<li>Cursor is set to cross while over the drawing area</li>
    </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Brush tool:
       <ul>
        <li>When the brush tool is chosen, a user can draw lines by clicking and holding left 
		mouse button in the drawing area.</li>
        <li>Brush color should be set to black and line thickness should be set to 1.</li>
		<li>Drawing can be stopped either by releasing the left mouse button or by pressing right 
		mouse button while still drawing.</li>
	   </ul>
	</li>
    <li>Colors section:
       <ul>
        <li>The group box is now filled with all colors from the KnownColor class.</li>
        <li>Each color is represented by a 25x25 square filled with that color.</li>
		<li>Clicking on the square changes the current painting color.</li>
		<li>The content inside the group box should be scrollable.</li>
		<li>Colors section has a flow layout - the wider the section is, the more colors it can fit in a single row.</li>
	   </ul>
	</li>
  <li>Hints:
    <ul>
        <li>TableLayoutPanel, PictureBox, SizeChanged Event</li>
        <li>MouseDown, MouseMove, MouseUp Events, Graphics methods, Refresh method</li>
        <li>FlowLayoutPanel, AutoScroll Property, Color.FromKnownColor Method</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>Note: In all doubtful and untold aspects application should behave like example app (except possible bugs)</i></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Scoring:
	
	<ul>
		<li>Layout:
		<ul>
			<li>Left panel with bitmap - <b>2p</b></li>
			<li>Bitmap scalability - <b>1p</b></li>
			<li>Right panel - <b>1p</b></li>
			<li>Top toolstrip - <b>1p</b></li>
	    </ul>
		</li>
		<li>Logic:
		<ul>
			<li>Filling the color panel with flow layout and scrolling - <b>3p</b></li>
			<li>Brush tool - <b>2p</b></li>
			<li>Changing the cursor upon picking a tool - <b>1p</b></li>
			<li>Correct mouse button capturing - <b>1p</b></li>
	    </ul>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>---------------------------------------------------------------</h2>

<h2>Home Part</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="MiniPaintHome.exe">Example application</a></li>
  <li>General:
       <ul>
	   <li>The icons used in the example app can be found <a href="icons.zip">here</a></li>
	   <li>One of the supported languages must be English - the second one is unrestricted.</li>
	   <li>Each section in the toolstrip is separated by a vertical separator (just like in the example app)</li>
       </ul>
  </li>
  <li>File section:
       <ul>
	   <li>Bitmap can now be both saved and loaded using the following file extensions: .png, .bmp, .jpeg</li>
	   <li>Window size should adjust to the loaded bitmap size.</li>
       </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tools section:
       <ul>
	    <li>Apart from the brush tool a rectangle tool and ellipse tool is present.</li>
		<li>Both of the new tools work just like in MS Paint - holding the left mouse button and moving over the drawing 
		area displays a shape and when the left mouse button is released 
		the shape is permanently added to the bitmap.</li>
		<li>Clicking the right mouse button during the shape creation cancels the event.</li>
		<li>Only one tool can be picked at a time.</li>
		<li>Clear tool simply clears the bitmap with white color.</li>
		<li>Line thickness can be chosen for all tools (1-small, 2-medium, 3-big) </li>
       </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Chosen color:
       <ul>
	    <li>The tooltip also contains a small box displaying currently chosen color.</li>
	    <li>Apart from that, whenever a user chooses the color from the color section on 
		the right, chosen color is emphasized by a dashed square in negative to the chosen color</li>
		</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Languages & localization:
       <ul>
	   <li>The application should be localizable and should support two languages.</li>
		<li>When launched, application is set to english.</li>
		<li>The toolstrip contains two buttons that - when clicked - change the current culture info. 
		Every string (including the tooltips) is changed to another language. </br><b>Warning:</b> this
		should be done using the .resx files 
		and localization, changing Text and Title properties won't be approved.</li>
		<li>All the controls should be properly reloaded after the culture change. That includes the chosen tool, thickness, etc.</li>
		<li>The window should stay in the same position and maintain the same size.</li>
		</ul>
  </li>

  <li>Hints:
    <ul>
		<li>Image.Save, Image.FromFile</li>
        <li>DrawEllipse, DrawRectangle</li>
        <li>Invalidate method, DashPattern, Color.ToArgb, Color.FromArgb</li>
        <li>Form.Localizable, CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>Note: In all doubtful and untold aspects application should behave like example app (except possible bugs)</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Approximate scoring:
	<ul>
		<li> proper file saving and loading - <b>2p</b></li>`
        <li> rectangle, ellipse tools - <b>3p</b></li>
		<li> clear tool and thickness - <b>1p</b></li>
		<li> chosen color box in the toolstrip - <b>1p</b></li>
        <li> dashed line around the chosen color in the colors section - <b>1p</b></li>
		<li> changing languages with localization - <b>2p</b></li>
        <li> proper application behavior after changing a language - <b>2p</b></ li>
		
		<li><i>Note: To pass part 2, all of the functionality of the part 1 must be fulfilled.</i></li>
